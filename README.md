# Sql_-_Excel_Portfolio_Project
This project is part of my data analytics portfolio, showcasing my ability to analyze business data using MySQL for data cleaning and exploration, and Excel for visualization and dashboard creation.

The goal of this project was to analyze pizza sales performance, identify sales trends, top-selling categories and present actionable insights through an interactive Excel dashboard.
